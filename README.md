# SudokuSolver

#The program uses the API pygame to develop this project.

#The algorithm used within the code is the backtracking algorithm. The algorithm is contained within solver.py.

#Two class functions are added into the main py file.
#The first class is button.
#The second class is tile which inherited the button class.

#The sudoku_solver_app.py reimplements the backtracking algorithm in solver.py in order to display how the backtracking algorithm works realtime.

#To use the app:

#Add the necessary puzzle by clicking on the squares to add the respective numbers.
#When done, click solve.
#The app will display the backtracking algorithm working on the puzzle for the user to see.
#At the end, click clear to clear the board.
